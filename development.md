## Build & Run

```
nvm use 20
npm i --force
npm start
```

## Open

Once started, go to http://localhost:3000/ and see the result, click on components, go to other pages, etc.

To fully experience the implementation, check https://getlibreforgedemo.github.io/ - this one allows to test the Google SSO, as http://localhost:3000/ isn't registered as allowed redirect uri.
